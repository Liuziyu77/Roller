# PinchBench

[Documentation](../index.md) · [Bench integration and scoring](bench-format.md) · [OpenClaw configuration](../harnesses/openclaw-configuration.md)

Roller reads PinchBench tasks from `tasks/manifest.yaml`. It supports automated grading, LLM
judging, hybrid grading, and multiple sessions. The upstream repository is
<https://github.com/pinchbench/skill>.

## Prepare the environment

```bash
scripts/prepare-pinchbench.sh "$PWD/.benchmarks/pinchbench"
export PINCHBENCH_ROOT="$PWD/.benchmarks/pinchbench"

export MODEL_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1
export MODEL_API_KEY=replace-with-your-api-key
export ROLLER_RUN_ROOT="$PWD/runs/pinchbench"
mkdir -p "$ROLLER_RUN_ROOT"
```

`prepare-pinchbench.sh` clones the upstream data when the target directory is missing and pulls
the pinned `linux/amd64` OpenClaw image. It does not update an existing checkout. The script
prints the commit for experiment records and does not read or write API keys. To prepare the
environment manually, clone <https://github.com/pinchbench/skill> and pull
`ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:2026.7.1-2`.

OpenClaw also requires a model configuration. Save the following as `example.models.json`, then
replace the API URL, key, and model ID with the values from the model provider:

```json
{
  "mode": "merge",
  "providers": {
    "example": {
      "baseUrl": "${MODEL_API_BASE_URL}",
      "apiKey": "${MODEL_API_KEY}",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "timeoutSeconds": 600,
      "models": [{"id": "example-model", "name": "Example model"}]
    }
  }
}
```

Before starting a larger job, run two automatically graded tasks. These tasks do not require a judge:

```bash
roller collect --bench pinchbench --bench-root "$PINCHBENCH_ROOT" \
  --bench-variant automated-only \
  --bench-task-id task_sanity --bench-task-id task_files \
  --model example/example-model --model-config example.models.json \
  --parallel 1 --grader-parallel 1 \
  --output "$ROLLER_RUN_ROOT" --run-name smoke
```

The command writes `smoke/tasks.jsonl` and
`smoke/bench-report.json`.

The `all` and `core` variants contain LLM and hybrid grading tasks. For a result comparable to
the upstream PinchBench setup, keep the default judge,
`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`. Roller sends judge requests to
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`; therefore this run requires only an OpenRouter key:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...

roller collect --bench pinchbench --bench-root "$PINCHBENCH_ROOT" \
  --bench-variant core --bench-timeout-multiplier 2 \
  --model example/example-model --model-config example.models.json \
  --samples 1 --parallel 1 --grader-parallel 1 \
  --output "$ROLLER_RUN_ROOT" --run-name core
```

## Variants

| Variant | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | Every task in the manifest; this is the default |
| `automated-only` | Tasks with automated graders, useful for checking the environment |
| `core` | The core subset declared by the manifest |

## Execution and scoring

Roller takes a content-addressed snapshot of `workspace_files` and copies it into a writable
workspace for each sample. It never changes the upstream checkout.
`sessions[].new_session: true` starts another OpenClaw session in the same container, and the
filesystem is preserved. The grader receives the combined transcript. Private answers for the image task
are placed in the container after the agent exits.

The default judge request matches the current upstream PinchBench settings:
`anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`, `temperature=0`,
`max_completion_tokens=2048`, no streaming, a 300-second timeout, and one request. A separate
3600-second wall-clock limit stops a hung grader process without changing that request.

For a custom OpenAI-compatible judge, set `PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_BASE_URL`,
`PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_API_KEY`, and `PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_MODEL`. Set
`PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS_FIELD=max_tokens` or
`PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_STREAM=true` only when the endpoint requires it. Scores from a different judge
model are not directly comparable to the official result.

A reasoning model may exhaust the default 2048-token budget before it emits JSON. Increase the budget
with `PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_MAX_TOKENS=8192`. When `PINCHBENCH_JUDGE_RETRIES` is greater than zero,
Roller retries network errors and successful responses without a parseable score. If streamed
`content` is empty, the grader also checks `reasoning_content`.

Roller keeps frontmatter `prerequisites` in bench metadata. For the four FWS/GWS/GitHub
integration tasks, it installs pinned versions of `fws`, `gws`, and `gh` in the disposable
task container and starts the upstream FWS mock service. These downloads use the shell's HTTP(S)
proxy settings.

## Upstream option mapping

| PinchBench | Roller |
| --- | --- |
| `--model`, `--base-url`, `--thinking` | `collect --model`, model config/`--api-base`, `--thinking` |
| `--judge` | Uses the official judge by default; override it with the judge model, base URL, and key environment variables |
| `--suite all/automated-only`, task IDs, core/category | `collect --bench-variant`, `--bench-task-id`, `--bench-category` |
| `--runs N` | `collect --samples N` |
| `--timeout-multiplier N` | `collect --bench-timeout-multiplier N` |
| parallel judge toggle | `collect --grader-parallel N`; use 1 for serial grading |
| `--no-fail-fast` | Roller records failures and continues the run |
| upload/register/trend/judge cache | Roller does not implement these leaderboard and post-processing features |

Roller writes reports locally and does not upload them to the PinchBench leaderboard. Tasks that
use search, email, calendar, third-party integrations, or a skill registry still require the corresponding
network access and credentials. Roller prepares the four upstream FWS mock tasks automatically.
